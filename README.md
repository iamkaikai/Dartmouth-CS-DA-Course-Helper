# Dartmouth-CS-DA-Course-Helper
Dartmouth CS/DA Course Helper is a tool for people who wants to check the course dependency graph of the Dartmouth CS program without opening a new tab of the actual course page. The extension is a little hack based on the DOM of "diagrams.net" (formerly draw.io)
<br/>
# Install the extension
1. Download the files above and put them in to a same folder. 
2. Load the entire folder with the "Load unpacked" button in 	> chrome://extensions/  (You can also install the extension through Chrome web store)

After the install,you will see an icon on the toolbar. The extension will turn on automatically, and it only works for the pages under > viewer.diagrams.net (if you wish to use it under another site, change the setting in manifest.json)

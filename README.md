# Dartmouth-CS-DA-Course-Helper
Dartmouth CS/DA Course Helper is a tool for people who wants to check the [course dependency graph](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate-courses#course-dag) of the Dartmouth CS program without opening a new tab of the actual course page. The extension is a little hack based on the DOM of "diagrams.net" (formerly draw.io)
<br/>
# Install the extension
1. Download the files above and put them in to a same folder. (or directly install the extension from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dartmouth-csda-course-hel/mfbffgihnbhpgidccogbkcpcldmoeenf))
2. Load the entire folder with the "Load unpacked" button in chrome://extensions/  (You can also install the extension through Chrome web store) <br/> <br/>

<br/>
After the install,you will see an icon on the toolbar. The extension will turn on automatically, and it only works for the pages under > viewer.diagrams.net (if you wish to use it under another site, change the setting in manifest.json)
<br/>

# How to use it
Now you can go the the course dependancy graph, and you will see a green window at the bottom left corner. Just hover your cursor on the course circle and you can see the course description page in the window. <br/>
